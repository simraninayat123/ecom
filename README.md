## Description

Morrow Supply is a small e-commerce starter with a NestJS API, Prisma/Postgres
database, and Next.js storefront.

## Run locally

```bash
# install API dependencies
npm install

# start Postgres, apply tracked migrations, and load sample catalogue data
npm run db:up
cp .env.example .env
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# in one terminal
npm run start:dev

# in another terminal
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:3000` and the storefront at
`http://localhost:3001`.

### API routes

- `POST /auth/register` and `POST /auth/login`
- `GET /users/me` with a bearer token
- `GET /categories` and `GET /categories/:slug`
- `GET /products?search=mug&category=home&minPrice=1000&maxPrice=5000&sort=price_asc&page=1&limit=20`
- `GET /products/:idOrSlug`
- `GET /cart`, `POST /cart/items`, `PATCH /cart/items/:itemId`, `DELETE /cart/items/:itemId`, `DELETE /cart` (bearer token)
- `GET /addresses`, `POST /addresses`, `PATCH /addresses/:id`, `DELETE /addresses/:id` (bearer token)
- `POST /checkout`, `GET /orders`, and `GET /orders/:id` (bearer token)
- `GET /health` and `GET /docs`

Admin routes require a bearer token for a user whose role is `ADMIN`:

- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /admin/categories...`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /admin/products...`
- `POST/DELETE /admin/products/:productId/images...`
- `POST/PATCH/DELETE /admin/products/:productId/variants...`
- `POST /admin/products/:productId/inventory`
- `GET /admin/orders?status=PROCESSING&paymentStatus=PAID`
- `PATCH /admin/orders/:id/status`

Order status changes are limited to valid transitions. Product deletion is a soft delete, and inventory adjustments create an audit record in the same database transaction as the stock change.

Public product responses contain only active and published products. Prices and all order totals are integer minor units in the product/order currency, defaulting to INR. Cart and order queries are scoped to the authenticated user.

### Postman examples

Register and save the returned `accessToken`:

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{"name":"Asha","email":"asha@example.com","password":"password123"}
```

Add an address, add a product to the cart, then checkout:

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/addresses
Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}
Content-Type: application/json

{"label":"Home","recipientName":"Asha","line1":"1 Main Street","city":"Pune","state":"MH","postalCode":"411001","country":"IN"}

POST http://localhost:3000/cart/items
Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}
Content-Type: application/json

{"productId":"{{productId}}","quantity":2}

POST http://localhost:3000/checkout
Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}
Content-Type: application/json

{"shippingAddressId":"{{addressId}}"}
```

```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Observability

In production applications, observability is essential for understanding how your system behaves, detecting issues early, and maintaining reliable performance.

[NestJS Observe](https://observe.nestjs.com) automatically instruments your NestJS application, giving you deep visibility into your system with minimal setup:

- **Distributed tracing:** Follow requests across services and understand how they flow through your system.
- **Waterfall analysis:** Visualize request execution and identify slow operations, bottlenecks, and unexpected delays.
- **Performance analysis:** Analyze application performance in real time and quickly pinpoint areas that need optimization.
- **Metrics:** Track key application and infrastructure metrics to understand system health and performance trends.
- **Logging:** Centralize and correlate logs with traces and other telemetry to make debugging easier.
- **Error tracking:** Detect errors quickly and investigate their root causes with the surrounding context.
- **SLA monitoring:** Track service-level objectives and identify when your application is approaching or exceeding defined thresholds.
- **Alarms and alerts:** Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, SLA violations, and other anomalies so your team can react quickly.
